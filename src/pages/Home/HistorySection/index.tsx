              Samar I Electric Cooperative, Inc. (SAMELCO I) was incorporated
              with the National Electrification Commission on February 27, 1974.
              It started actual operation three months later, on May 27, 1974.
              Its initial membership numbered 800 members, all coming from the
              defunct Calbayog Electric Plant, whose system was taken over by
              the newly organized electric cooperative created under RA 6038 as
              amended by PD 269. It has two 2 units of CAT fuel-run generators
              at its power plant in Brgy. Capoocan, Calbayog City, as the sole
              source of power supply. During these periods, SAMELCO I offices
              were housed on a 0.6-hectare lot in Brgy. Capoocan is where the
              power plant was located. In 1980, it eventually transferred to its
              new headquarters, sprawled on a 3â€“4-hectare lot located in Brgy.
              Carayman, about 5 kilometers south of the City of Calbayog, is
              situated along the Maharlika Highway, fronting a seashore turned
              into an open beach resort.
